"""
application module
Domain module: defines core application behaviour logic using langgraph and langchain.

This includes:
- client setup (e.g.) the llm engine client constants.
- a Factory pattern function to construct reflexive reasoning graphs (e.g. stategraph_factory_constructor)
- the node functions that are the basic building blocks of the graph (e.g. evaluator_node)
- The orchestrator function that executes the workflow of the graph.
- The NamedTuples design as basic data estructure for the Factory pattern function.
